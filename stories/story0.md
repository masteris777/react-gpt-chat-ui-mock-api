Certainly! Here's a simple "Hello, World!" program written in the C programming language:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

In this C program, the `#include <stdio.h>` line includes the standard input/output library, which provides functions like `printf` for displaying output on the console.
